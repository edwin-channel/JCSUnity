# JCSUnity

JCSUnity is a component driven framework built to allow the user
to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics and features
such as UI functionality and player movement. This will allow
for a faster initial development. Most components work individually
while other components must be used in tandem with others.
Individually components can be combined to create new behaviors.


## :boom: Important Notice

All media assets inside JCSUnity do not fall under its license.
These assets are placeholders only, and should only be used for
testing purposes. They are NOT, under any circumstances, to be
used commercially. By using this framework you agree to these
terms, and understand that you are solely responsible for any
legal action taken against you for using, or attempting to use
any placeholder assets commercially.

## :hammer: How to use it?

JCSUnity is like other Unity plugins. You can download the latest
release from the above tab, or from the link
[here](https://github.com/jcs090218/JCSUnity/releases/latest)
. Simply create a new project in Unity then import all of
the assets into that project. Then you can start all of the tools
in the JCSUnity framework. <br/>
